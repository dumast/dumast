### Greetings, welcome to my profile

## About
I am Terence Dumas, a young developer currently on a programming journey. I was born in France but moved to the US back when I was about 7 years old. Indeed, I can speak multiple languages such as English, French, Spanish (which I studied in class) and I am currently learning Japanese through self-taught methods. I started programming with Python when I was in 6th grade and then recently slipped onto different languages such as C and JavaScript, which I am the most confortable with.
