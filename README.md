### Hey guys, welcome to my profile!

## About
I am a Computer Science sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin with a minor in Robotics. I am currently building RyteStart, a startup that aims to reduce friction between data collection and data engagement. We are launching Mele this upcoming year in high schools, an ecosystem for Chefs and school administrations to collect student feedback on food effectively. Concretely, we are turning the mundane task of filling out surveys into a fun game with leaderboards, friend groups, and real-life rewards.
If you guys want to learn more, we have an Instagram to document our entrepreneurship journey https://www.instagram.com/mele.app/.
My programming strengths and experience include Web, App, Backend Development, and Robotics, but I am open to learning any technology to achieve my goals.
